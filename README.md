# Fizzbuzz

By [Mary Dickson](www.marydickson.info).

## Description

This is a ruby coding challenge that contains a classic fizzbuzz solution and a custom fizzbuzz method.

## Usage

ruby fizzbuzz.rb
* call method fizzbuzz(toplimit) for standard fizzbuzz (returned as a string with space-seperated values)

ruby advancedbuzz.rb
* call method fizzbuzzhash(options, top_limit) for custom fizzbuzz: where option is a hash, ex: myoptions = {7 => "Sivv", 13 => "Grr"}; fizzbuzzhash(myoptions, 100)
* call method fizzbuzz(divisor, output, top_limit) for just one custom divisor and output, ex: fizzbuzz(7, "Sivv", 100)
* both return as "puts" to console
